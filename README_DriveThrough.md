# Drive Through

Drive Through is a problem-solving game developed through the use of Pygame that tasks an individual with achieving a numerical result by driving through squares that suddenly appear on the game map. The user uses arrow keys to control the car, making it move right and left to attempt to drive over the squares that may result in the desired number and avoid the squares that may make the player be further from the number. Essentially, the project utilizes pygame, random, and time modules in conjunction with various pertinent functions and imported assets to create an entertaining situation. 

## Goals

The goals of this project were to utilize the lessons learned in class and apply them to creative and entertaining projects. 
It is meant to challenge me, Austin Pearl, into seeing how I could use my basic skills and knowledge attained from the class to build something and face the obstacles that may be in my way. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
an individual needs a program to be able to display the code, possibly Python's IDLE or preferably Microsoft Visual Studio

pygame would need to be installed into the user's computer before the game can actually be initiated.

github provides the lovely opportunity for users to download code straight from the website. The download button is typically green and can easily be clicked to import the files onto one's own computer.

The Time and Random modules should be installed in the user's computer as well as Python (duh!)


### Installing

To install pygame

Open the command prompt

type in "pip install pygame"

### Instructions

Once all the files have been downloaded, open the FinalProject Folder. Then proceed to open the Drive_Through.py file.
In the file, all assets are linked to the programmer's original directory. Press ctrl + f and fill in the searchbar with 
C:/Users/apearl3/Documents/Programming Class/GitHub/python_programming_3545/FinalProject/
Proceed to replace each of these directory links with the ones on your own computer. 

Once completed, the program's debugger should allow the user to play the game, which will emerge as a GUI.

The instructions for the game itself:

- The player is given a target score that he/she/they will attempt to reach using the falling squares on the screen
-The squares can multiple, add, subtract, or divide a player's current number 
-The player's current number will always remain between 0 and 99. A fraction will be rounded to the nearest number. 
- The player will attempt to see how many rounds he/she/they can last before the time runs out. 
- Losing will result in teh player receiving more time for the new game
-Cheat Code of the Day: Subtracting from zero will change the player's current number to 1
